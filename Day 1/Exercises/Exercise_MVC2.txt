This is next step of MVC1.

- Part 1 :

    First, edit your database. You have to add a new table : comments.
    This will hold : id, comment, #movie_id

    You have to create the relationship (foreign key) between comments and movies tables.

    You can manually enter comments if you want.

- Part 2 : 

    In your code, create a class 'Comment'. It will represent a specific comment, its attributes and so on....

- Part 3 :

    Now, change the 'Movie' class.
    A movie is designated by all its regular attributs and also an array of comments.

- Part 4 :

    Now, when you create a Movie object, you should attach all the comments to it.
    Meaning: when dealing with database, you should take all the comments also and give them to the Movie object.

- Part 5 :

    Change the views to match.
